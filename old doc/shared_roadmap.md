# Shared Roadmap

## Setup & Foundations
- Root folder: `C:\DevProjects\risk_flagship\`
  - `credit_flagship\`
  - `fraud_flagship\`
  - `shared_env\`
  - `docs_global\`

- Common environment setup: Python venv, shared dependencies, MLflow, Git, DVC.

- Stage 3: Transformation & feature engineering.
- Stage 4: Model development & registration.
- Stage 5: Batch scoring & Expected Loss.
- Stage 6: Monitoring (Evidently, SHAP).
- Stage 7: Reporting & dashboards.
- Stage 8: Automation & orchestration.
- Stage 9: Governance & CI/CD.

## Fraud Detection Project Roadmap
- Stage 2: Data ingestion & validation.
- Stage 3: Feature engineering (batch + streaming).
- Stage 4: ML model + rules integration.
- Stage 5: Scoring API (FastAPI).
- Stage 6: Monitoring & alerts.
- Stage 7: Retraining & A/B testing.
- Stage 8: Reporting & dashboards.
- Stage 9: Automation & orchestration.
- Stage 10: Governance & CI/CD.
